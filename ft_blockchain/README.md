The objective of this project is to create a blockchain based on a (Proof of work)
algorithm. To do this, you will have to implement the logic of the block chain, as well as
a server through which you can interact with it.

### Explanation:

This project required us to create a PoW blockchain, so we must create every needed function, such as mine, transactions, hash calcs, etc... This program implements an ascending dynamic difficulty in the PoW algorithm.

As a bonus, I also created another program using the PoS (Proof of Stake) algorithm. Both programs must run as a http host, so to interact with them, I recommend using another program (Postman in my case), to send requests and posts easier.
