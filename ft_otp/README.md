# Ft_otp


In this project, the aim is to implement a TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) system (without using pyotp or any similar library), which will be capable of generating ephemeral passwords from a master key.

## Usage

./ft_otp [-g <key>.hex] [-k ft_otp.key]

- The [-g] option, recieves a file that includes a master key with a 64 hexadecimal characters format, and generates an encrypted ft_otp.key file.

- The [-k] option takes the .key file given as argument, generates the one-time password manually, and prints it, also including the password generated by pyotp library, to check if they are the same.

## BONUS PART

This project includes a bonus part, which required us to implement a graphic interface as we like, this is included in the ft_otp_UI program, which just needs to be executed with **./ft_otp_UI**, and a new window will be opened.
In this bonus, I implemented various functions:
- Blank space to introduce the master key, with the posibility to generate it randomly
- Generate file button, which requires you to set a password that you will need to introduce to generate the otp.
- Generate OTP button, which generates the otp (showed in the window), and also a qr image, that you can scan to add the password to the Google Authenticator app.
