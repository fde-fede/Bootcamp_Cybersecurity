# Recovery

Evidence gathering is an essential process that has to be done before performing any
kind of forensics analysis. Having the evidence clear and organized will make your labor
easier. The objective of this project is making a program that is able to extract some
artifacts on a given time lapse.

### Usage

We must run this program in a Windows 10 image, and it will start geting all the information such as:

- Registry branches changes date
- Recent used/opened files
- Installed programs
- Processes on execution
- Web browser history
- Connected devices
- Event logs

We also included some bonus part:

When we launch the program, it will expose all the information in the console, but it will also open two graphic windows that were required as the bonus:

- Compose a time line where all the evidence is displayed organized by categories and time.
-  Show the directory tree on some kind of graphic view
